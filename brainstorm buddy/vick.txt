Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Michael Vick was present Tuesday at the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in an effort to encourage voters to pass an animal-rights bill, per TMZ Sports.

According to ESPN.com's Jeremy Fowler, PA House Bill 1516 would allow police officers to rescue dogs or cats from vehicles should the temperature inside reach an unsafe temperature.

Vick isn't the first NFL player to raise awareness regarding the dangers of leaving a pet in a hot car. Arizona Cardinals star Tyrann Mathieu partnered with PETA for a public service announcement in July:   

In 2007, Vick was sentenced to 23 months in prison for his role in a dogfighting ring, ultimately serving 19 months in Leavenworth, Kansas. Upon his release, Vick has worked with the Humane Society and fought for the passage of a federal law in 2011 that punished those who brought minors to, and knowingly attended, animal fights.

"I know that I'm an unlikely advocate," said Vick on Monday, per Fowler. "I was part of the problem. Now, my perspective can help reach people that activists can't reach. I can help others become agents of change."
